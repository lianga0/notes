class="post-message " data-role="message" dir="auto"><div><p>I'm confused by the latency that you mentioned - I just did lots of research lately as part of articles I wrote on Golden Signals / tools (runqstat) and I'm very confused by the CPU run queue latency in /proc/schedstat - this does not seem to really measure what you describe.</p><p>You wrote &amp; I expect a sum of runnable process time waiting for a CPU, but in my measurements it vastly exceeds this number even on very lightly loaded systems.</p><p>Instead it seems to measure tasks in ANY non-running state, i.e. how long since a task has run, even if it has no work to do - it appears to be dozens of seconds for every second its sampled (and of course subtracted from the prior count value) - it simple cannot be higher than 1 second per second on an non-saturated system, but was dozens or hundreds on my tests (I can easily be doing something wrong, of course; and this doesn't really seem to be in Jiffies, either, or the results are even higher).</p><p>It appears this is used as part of the scheduling criteria to avoid starvation in the CFQ scheduler, i.e. the sum of all tasks not-running, so if there are 100 non-running tasks/processes, this will go up by about 100 seconds per second.</p><p>I hope I'm missing something, as I'd love to find a way to measure this, ideally in /proc and without

So 0.62 x 1.15 + 0.38 x 1.25 = 1.18. That's pretty close to the 1.19 reported.</p><p>which is your earlier graphs?<br>what is the 0.62 and 0.38 mean? the time?</p><p>oh, I get it:<br>The so-called "one minute average" only reaches about

seems evident (%CPU is 32.3)<br>* 0.69 is supposedly 0.8576 * 0.8139 (tar share * vfs_read share). But why do one need to multiple these shares? These values are global, not relative to the parent.<br>* 0.04 is hard to get as there is no mpstat in the preceding figure, but there is the formula in the text.<br>* 0.11: the two leftmost towers on the off-cpu flame graph sum up to 0.14, not 0.11 - where do I get that number?</p><p>Many thanks</p></div></div><span class="post-media"><ul data-role="post-media-list"></ul></span></div></div><a

In UNIX they were used when waiting for a disk block to be read. Since the disk read was something that happened really fast (well, it seemed like it at the time) the process would start again very soon and so should still be considered runnable. In the Linux era, people didn't necessarily think about the consequences of unkillable processes and used uninterruptible waits as an easy wait to avoid accommodating signals in their implementations. This skewed the load average as well as causing reboots to get rid of unkillable processes. Over the past year or so, I think Linus Torvalds has become a bit more aware of the issue, but there is a lot of education needed.</p><p>In terms of actual programming, you should only use an uninterruptible wait if you *know* an operation will complete quickly. Otherwise, handle the signal in an interruptible wait or use a timeout.</p></div></div><span class="post-media"><ul data-role="post-media-list"></ul></span></div></div><a class="see-more hidden"
